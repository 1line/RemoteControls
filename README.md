2. Add the RemoteControls.h and RemoteControls.m classes to your Plugins folder in Xcode
3. Add the RemoteControls.js file to your www folder
4. Add the RemoteControls.js to your html file. eg: `<script type="text/javascript" charset="utf-8" src="RemoteControls.js"></script>`
5. Add the plugin to your config.xml: `<plugin name="RemoteControls" value="RemoteControls" />` (or if you are running an older version of PhoneGap / Cordova, Cordova.plist under Plugins (key: "RemoteControls" value: "RemoteControls"))
6. In MainViewController.m add to -(void)viewDidLoad [[RemoteControls remoteControls] setWebView:self.webView];
7. Add this function to MainViewController.m
- (void)remoteControlReceivedWithEvent:(UIEvent *)receivedEvent {

       [[RemoteControls remoteControls] receiveRemoteEvent:receivedEvent];
   }
