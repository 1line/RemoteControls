RemoteControls
==========

PhoneGap / Cordova iOS plugin that allows you to use the Remote Controls as well as add metadatas in RemoteControlsInfoCenter

Require
-------

- PhoneGap / Cordova 3.x
- metadata portion forked from of https://github.com/silverorange/RemoteControls

Installation
------------

Add the plugin much like any other:

1. Add MediaPlayer.framework in your project.
2. Add the RemoteControls.h and RemoteControls.m classes to your Plugins folder in Xcode
3. Add the RemoteControls.js file to your www folder
4. Add the RemoteControls.js to your html file. eg:
```javascript
`<script type="text/javascript" charset="utf-8" src="RemoteControls.js"></script>`

5. Add the plugin to your config.xml:
```javascript
`<plugin name="RemoteControls" value="RemoteControls" />` (or if you are running an older version of PhoneGap / Cordova, Cordova.plist under Plugins (key: "RemoteControls" value: "RemoteControls"))

6. In MainViewController.m add to
```javascript
- (void)viewDidLoad
{
    [super viewDidLoad];
    [[UIApplication sharedApplication] beginReceivingRemoteControlEvents];
    // Do any additional setup after loading the view from its nib.
    [[RemoteControls remoteControls] setWebView:self.webView];
}

- (void)viewDidUnload
{
    [super viewDidUnload];
    // Release any retained subviews of the main view.
    // e.g. self.myOutlet = nil;
    // Turn off remote control event delivery
    [[UIApplication sharedApplication] endReceivingRemoteControlEvents];
}

7. Add this function to MainViewController.m
- (void)remoteControlReceivedWithEvent:(UIEvent *)receivedEvent {

       [[RemoteControls remoteControls] receiveRemoteEvent:receivedEvent];
   }


### Example
```javascript
function onDeviceReady() {
  artist = "Daft Punk";
  title = "One More Time";
  album = "Discovery";
  image = "path_within_documents_storage";
  elapsedTime = my_media.getDuration();

  var params = [artist, title, album, image,  elapsedTime];
  window.plugins.remoteControls.updateMetas(function(success){
      console.log(success);
  }, function(fail){
      console.log(fail);
  }, params);
}
```
